# OpenAI API Training Notes

This folder is for building and testing OpenAI API conversation workflows.

Key points:
- Use environment variables for API keys (never hardcode).
- The main script demonstrates a simple user/assistant message flow.
- For longer conversations, keep track of token limits and context.
- Always handle errors and rate limits in production code.

Next steps:
- Add error handling and retry logic.
- Add tests for conversation flow.
- Explore advanced OpenAI features as needed.
